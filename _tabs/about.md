我叫Kesler，就讀清華大學工學院學士班大一，想往資工領域發展。很喜歡的一句話是Tim Urban的一篇部落格標題 ***"Life is a Picture, But You Live in a Pixel."***。想成為性格有趣、溫柔有內涵的電資男。

My name is Kesler. I'm studying at Tsing Hua University Interdisciplinary Program of Engineering as a freshman. One quote I like a lot is from one of Tim Urban's blog title, ***"Life is a Picture, But You Live in a Pixel."*** I would try to become a interesting, gentle and profound CS guy.
